SpyCam is an App to detect people using the Mac's built in iSight and add them to your address book and much more!

Current Features thought about (WIP):

Person Profiling = When Person is detected, click on that person's face and you can fill in Email Address, Pic, Name Personal Info etc.

Person Profiling Info can be added to Address Book

Camera Snapshots

Face Recognition

Execute Actions when specified person is detected on camera, e.g. Quit an App, Hide an App

Start and Stop Detecting People Buttons

Un-Mirorred Camera (Mac Camera is currently Mirorred, we have to mirror it back to get the right direction) [Note: This will not be done due to the fact that the mirrored camera makes text unreadable.]

Extra Stuff: There is an icon in the menu bar and when clicked on miniature version of app comes out, there is a button to toggle the actual app on the menu bar version of the app
